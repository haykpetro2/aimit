                     A notable feature is how the Support page is embedded into the AimIt portal. This makes the page more accessible
                     to the user and saves your precious time. It is user-friendly and provides info about what exact benefits for your
                     business with our tech support you can experience, support levels, and design consultation, besides the 'Get in Touch'
                     section which gives you a fantastic opportunity that helps businesses submit their ideas directly to the company for
                     consideration or just get in touch."
