The aim is typically to rank on the first page of Google results for search terms that mean the most to your target audience.
                  So, SEO is as much about understanding the wants and needs of your audience as it is about the technical nature of how to configure your website.`,

    description: `PPC advertising is ideal for small businesses as you get to decide how much you’re willing to spend on each keyword, so you can manage how much you will be spending when your ads are displayed. In essence, this ensures that the money you spend on ads isn't wasted, as you’re more likely to attract more people who are interested in your product.
                  If PPC is working as it should, the return on ad spend (ROAS) should be high, as a visit to your site is worth more than what you pay for it. It consists of choosing the right keywords, arranging those keywords into well-organized campaigns and ad groups.`,
