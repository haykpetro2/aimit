    title: 'WEB & DESKTOP DESIGN',
    description: `Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and
                  maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic
                  design; user interface design(UI design); authoring, including standardized code
                  and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine
                  optimization(SEO). The term “web design” is normally used to describe the design
                  process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including
                  writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope
                  of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability
                  and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.`,

    title: 'REDESIGN',
    description: `Redesign – any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections
                  made) at any time before, during, or after production. Revision in appearance,
                  function, or content. A plan for making changes to the structure and functions of
                  an artifact, building, or system so as to better purposes different from those set
                  forth in the original design.`,

    title: 'MOBILE APP DESIGN',
    description: `Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed
                  for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital
                  assistants, or mobile phones. These software applications are designed to run on
                  mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computers. These applications can
                  be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web
                  applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to
                  provide an application-like experience within a web browser. As part of the
                  development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the
                  creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input,
                  and mobility as outlines for design.`,
